I am a postdoc fellow currently working at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics of Academia Sinica (ASIAA) in Taipei, Taiwan.
My research interests are focused on the dynamical properties of galaxies and how these relate to the
star formation processes. I am particularly interested in characterizing the inflowing motions driven by the larges nonaxisymmetric components
of galaxies.
