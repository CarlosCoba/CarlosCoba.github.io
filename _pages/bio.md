Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlos LÃ³pez CobÃ¡ and I am from Mexico, specifically from the Mayan Peninsula where is located one of the seven wonders of the world, [ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichen_Itza). I got my Ph.D degree in Astrophysics back in 2021 at
the Institute of Astronomy UNAM, under the thesis "Systematic study of outflows in the Local Universe".
During my PhD I worked mostly with integral field spectroscopic data, namely [CALIFA](https://califa.caha.es/), [MaNGA-SDSS](https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/manga/), [MUSE/VLT](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html), to characterize the physical properties
of star-forming and AGN-driven outflows in nearby galaxies.
After my PhD, I moved to ASIAA Taiwan to conduct independent research, where I focused my investigations in understanding the processes that shape the dynamics of
galaxies. My research was driven by these questions:  Why we cannot fully reproduce the velocity field of basically any galaxy ?, Is it because the lack of methods or due to our misunderstanding of the gas-flows processes in galaxies ?.

I have experience working with 3D spectroscopic datasets. From IFS data tracing different phases of the warm interstellar medium, to colder gas phases like CO observed with ALMA.
The great advantage with working with kinematics, is that the spectral axis can be always converted to a velocity space!.
