Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlos LÃ³pez CobÃ¡ and I am from Mexico. I got my Ph.D degree in Astrophysics back in 2021 at
the Institute of Astronomy UNAM, under the thesis "Systematic study of outflows in the Local Universe".
During my PhD I worked mostly with integral field spectroscopic data, namely [CALIFA][https://califa.caha.es/], [MaNGA-SDSS}[https://www.sdss4.org/surveys/manga/], [MUSE/VLT][https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/muse.html], to characterize the physical properties
of star-forming and AGN-driven outflows in nearby galaxies.
After my PhD I moved to ASIAA Taiwan to conduct independent research, where I focused my investigations in understanding the processes that shape the dynamics of
galaxies.

Here in ASIAA, I developed software tools to accurate describe the velocity field of galaxies.
My research was driven by these questions:  Why we cannot fully reproduce the velocity field of basically any galaxy, Is it because the lack of
algorithms or due to our misunderstanding of gas-flows processes in galaxies.

I have worked with different datasets, tracing different phases of the interstellar medium. From the warm phase, like the ionized gas to colder phases like CO.

The great advantage of working with kinematics, is that the spectral axis can always be converted to velocity.
