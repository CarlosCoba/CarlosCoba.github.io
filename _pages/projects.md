[XS3D](https://github.com/CarlosCoba/XS3D) is a Python tool designed to model a wide variety of motions in disk like systems, including
galaxies and protoplanetary disk from 3D spectroscopic line observations. It is particularly useful to extract the circular rotation component, as well as other
noncircular motions present along the line-of-sight velocity.

XS3D implements corrections due to the finite resolution of the observations, namely the point spread function (PSF) and the line-spread function (LSF).
This is achieved by constructing a 3D kernel that will be convolved with a 3D model of the observation.
